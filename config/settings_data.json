              "answer": "<p>Most modern smartphones from 2018 onwards support eSIM, including iPhone XS+, Samsung Galaxy S20+, and Google Pixel 3+. Check our compatibility page for your specific device model or look for \"eSIM\" in your phone settings. View all <a href=\"/pages/esim-compatible-devices\" title=\"eSIM Compatible Devices\">compatible devices</a>!</p>"

              "question": "How do I check if my phone supports eSIM?",
              "answer": "<p>The easiest way is to check your phone settings: On iPhone, go to Settings &gt; Cellular/Mobile Data &gt; Add eSIM. On Android, go to Settings &gt; Network & Internet &gt; SIM cards. If you see these options, your device supports eSIM. Alternatively, dial *#06# to see if an EID number appears. Check our full compatibility list for your device!</p>"

              "question": "Can I use eSIM and physical SIM at the same time?",
              "answer": "<p>Yes! Most modern smartphones support dual SIM functionality, allowing you to use your physical SIM and Simbye eSIM simultaneously. This means you can keep your home number active for calls and texts while using the eSIM for affordable mobile data abroad. Simply enable both SIMs in your phone settings and choose which one to use for data.</p>"

              "question": "Can I transfer my eSIM to a new phone?",
              "answer": "<p>No, eSIMs cannot be transferred between devices. Once installed and activated on one device, the eSIM is permanently linked to that phone. If you get a new device, you'll need to purchase a new eSIM. However, Simbye eSIMs are affordable and start from just $1, making it easy to get connected on any device!</p>"

The installation process takes less than 60 seconds – just scan the QR code and follow the simple on-screen instructions. No technical knowledge required!</p>"

Once the eSIM is scanned and activated, refunds are no longer possible as the service has been used. For refund requests or questions, contact our 24/7 support team who will assist you promptly.</p>"

Unlimited plans include a fair use policy of 2GB high-speed data per day, after which speeds are reduced until the next 24-hour cycle. This ensures stable network performance for all users while giving you worry-free connectivity. Check availability for your destination!</p>"

              "answer": "<p>Your eSIM only activates when you arrive at your destination and it connects to the local network. You can install it anytime before departure using WiFi, but your data plan won't start counting down until you're actually in the country. Install early for peace of mind!</p>"

              "answer": "<p>Yes, absolutely! We recommend installing your eSIM at home before departure while you have stable WiFi. Your data plan won't activate until you arrive at your destination, so there's no risk of wasting data. Installation takes less than 60 seconds and saves you hassle at the airport!</p>"

Simply go to your phone's eSIM settings and select \"Enter Details Manually.\" Then input the SM-DP+ address and activation code provided in your email. Check our detailed manual installation guide for step-by-step help!</p>"

On Android, go to Settings &gt; Network & Internet &gt; SIMs &gt; [eSIM] &gt; Delete. However, keeping it installed doesn't harm your device if you plan to top up later!</p>"
